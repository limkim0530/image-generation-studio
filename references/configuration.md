# Configuration assistant

Use this reference when the user wants to configure image-generation-studio providers, models, aliases, API endpoints, API keys, or defaults. This includes casual requests like "Configure this interface for me.", "Add this API address.", "I want to use Grok for visualization.", "config.json is empty, how do I fill it in?."

The goal is to convert the user's natural-language description into a valid local `{baseDir}/config.json` update. Keep `SKILL.md` generic for distribution; `config.json` is user-specific runtime state and should be created locally only when configuration is needed.

## Provider and model resolution

The script chooses a provider/model at runtime from CLI flags and the user's local config:

1. `-m / --model` can be a built-in alias, a user-defined alias from `config.json`, or a raw model ID.
2. `--provider` can force a provider config by name. If both an alias and explicit provider are used, their adapters must be compatible.
3. When no provider/model is specified, the script uses the runtime config's `default_provider` and that provider's `default_model`; if the config is empty, the script falls back to its built-in defaults.

Model aliases resolve to `{provider, model}`, and each provider declares an adapter that controls the request format (`gemini`, `openai_images`, or `openai_responses`). Built-in aliases are convenience shortcuts; prefer user-defined aliases from `config.json` or explicit `--provider <name>` when the user has a custom provider/proxy. For repeatable results, prefer passing `-m <alias>` or `--provider <name>` explicitly instead of relying on implicit defaults.

Persistent `system_prompt` entries in `config.json` are intentionally ignored because they can become hidden global instructions for future calls. Use `--system-prompt` / `--system` only for instructions that should apply to the current invocation. Gemini sends the per-call value as native `system_instruction`; `openai_images` and `openai_responses` prepend it to the user prompt with a blank line separator.

## Configuration shape

`{baseDir}/config.json` may be missing, empty, or `{}`. Treat all of those as an empty config. If the user is configuring providers or aliases and the file is missing, create it locally with a normalized object like:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "my-provider",
  "providers": {
    "my-provider": {
      "adapter": "openai_images",
      "api_url": "https://provider.example",
      "default_model": "image-model-id"
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "friendly-alias": {
      "provider": "my-provider",
      "model": "image-model-id"
    }
  }
}
```

Keep existing providers and aliases unless the user asks to replace or remove them. Do not preserve or write top-level `system_prompt`; the CLI ignores persisted system prompts and only honors per-call `--system-prompt`.

## Adapter selection

Choose exactly one adapter for each provider:

| User description | adapter | Read next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gemini, Google GenAI, Nano Banana, `gemini-*` models, Google-compatible `generate_content` API | `gemini` | `references/adapter-gemini.md` |
| OpenAI Images API, `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits`, `gpt-image-*`, Grok Imagine, xAI image endpoints, most OpenAI-image-compatible proxies | `openai_images` | `references/adapter-openai-images.md` |
| OpenAI Responses API, `/v1/responses` with `image_generation` tool | `openai_responses` | `references/adapter-openai-responses.md` |

If the user says "OpenAI compatible" but does not specify Images vs Responses, ask which endpoint shape their provider exposes. If they mention `/v1/images/generations` or image edits, use `openai_images`. If they mention `/v1/responses`, use `openai_responses`.

After selecting an adapter, read the matching adapter reference before recommending adapter-specific command flags or deciding whether requested features such as editing, multi-image composition, aspect ratio, streaming, search, or response format are supported.

## Natural-language extraction

Extract these fields when present:

- provider name: a short config key such as `gemini`, `xai`, `openai`, `codex`, `newapi`, or a user-provided name. Normalize to lowercase kebab-case.
- adapter: infer from endpoint/model/provider wording using the table above.
- api_url: provider base URL that the CLI can append endpoint suffixes to. For example, convert `https://host/v1/images/generations` to `https://host` only when that base path really exposes `/v1/images/generations`; keep any required proxy prefix in the base URL.
- api_key: secret token. Prefer the provider-specific environment variable or per-call `--api-key`; store it in config only if the user explicitly accepts local secret storage.
- default_model: the model ID to use by default for that provider.
- alias: a friendly name under `models`, often the same as the model ID or user phrase like `fast-image`.
- default_provider: set it when the user says this should be the default, or when configuring the first provider in an empty config.
- system_prompt: do not write this to config. If the user wants a style/instruction prefix, use `--system-prompt` for that single call.

Ask only for missing required information. Required fields for default/no-`--model` use are `provider name`, `adapter`, `default_model`, and either `api_key` in config, a matching environment variable, or user intent to pass `--api-key` per call. If the user will always pass `--model`, `default_model` can be omitted. `api_url` can be omitted for official endpoints, but custom/proxy providers usually need it.

## Updating config.json

When enough information is available:

1. Read `{baseDir}/config.json` if it exists.
2. If it is missing, empty, or invalid JSON, start from `{}`. If invalid JSON has user content, tell the user before overwriting.
3. Ensure top-level `providers` and `models` are objects.
4. Merge the provider entry instead of replacing unrelated providers.
5. Add or update aliases requested by the user.
6. Set `default_provider` only when requested or when the config has no default yet.
7. Remove top-level `system_prompt` if present.
8. Write pretty JSON with two-space indentation.

Do not remove existing keys unless the user asks. Do not invent API keys, endpoints, or model IDs.

## Provider-specific environment variables

Provider names map to environment variables by uppercasing and replacing `-` with `_`:

- `gemini` → `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_URL`
- `my-images-provider` → `MY_IMAGES_PROVIDER_API_KEY`, `MY_IMAGES_PROVIDER_API_URL`

If the user is uncomfortable storing secrets in `config.json`, or has not explicitly accepted local secret storage, write config without `api_key` and tell them which env var to set.

## Confirmation style

After writing config, briefly report:

- provider name and adapter
- default model
- aliases added
- whether it is now the default provider
- where credentials are expected from: config or env var

Then give one concrete test command using `{baseDir}/scripts/generate.py`, `--provider`, and a small output filename.

## Examples

### OpenAI Images-compatible proxy

User: "Please configure `newapi` with the address `https://newapi.example`, key `<api-key>`, and model `gpt-image-2`. Name it `codex` and use it as the default from now on. Store the key in config."

Config update:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "codex",
  "providers": {
    "codex": {
      "adapter": "openai_images",
      "api_url": "https://newapi.example",
      "api_key": "<api-key>",
      "default_model": "gpt-image-2"
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "gpt-image-2": {
      "provider": "codex",
      "model": "gpt-image-2"
    }
  }
}
```

### Gemini-compatible provider without storing key

User: "I have the Gemini key, don't want to write it in a file, use gemini-3-pro-image-preview, don't store the key."

Config update:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "gemini",
  "providers": {
    "gemini": {
      "adapter": "gemini",
      "default_model": "gemini-3-pro-image-preview"
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "nano-banana-pro": {
      "provider": "gemini",
      "model": "gemini-3-pro-image-preview"
    }
  }
}
```

Tell the user to set `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
